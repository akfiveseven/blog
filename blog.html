            <p id="content">So, you're looking to find the best program to learn and practice programming. There are the classic editors such as Notepad, Notepad++, Atom, Sublime Text, hell, even Microsoft Word. Then there are Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, Visual Studio, and more. Nowadays, the most popular text editor is Visual Studio Code for general coding needs. In my opinion, VS Code is perfect for 99% of programmers. It is a free, fast and lightweight editor that has important features from popular IDEs and also has many community made extensions to improve functionality. However, none of these editors have the power and capabilities that are provided by Vim implementations and philosophies.</p>
